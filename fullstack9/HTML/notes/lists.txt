lists are used to list out items. we use daily grocery list, members list, todo list, jobs list,menu, contacts list, attandence list
some lists needs order and some don't
HTML divides lists into three categories
  1. ordered list: it is used to represent lists which needs an order
  2. unorderd list: it is used to represents list which doesn't need any order.
  3. definition lists: it is used to represent list which needs to be explained

1. Ordered Lists: 
   -- orderd lists uses ol tag and each list item will be li tag
   <ol type="A" start="9">
        <li>Jyothi</li>
        <li>Jeevana</li>
        <li>Jessica</li>
    </ol>
    There are total 5 types available(a,A,i,I,1)
    we can use start attribute to define where we can start our list. start always takesnumerical value.

2. unorderd lists: unordered lists use 'ul' tag and li for each list item
<ul>
        <li>milk</li>
        <li>oreo</li>
        <li>chocolate</li>
    </ul>  
By default, unordered list uses bullet points
3. Definition lists: definition lists uses dl for list and each item it need 'dt' and 'dd'
dt -- definition term
dd -- definition data

we can also keep one list inside anothe list called nested lists
