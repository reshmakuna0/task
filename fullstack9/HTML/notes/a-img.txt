anchor tag: anchor tag is used to connect another page / resource. it is done by 'a' tag and it uses attributes like 
  href-- contains link/path to connect
  target -- we use _blank value to open new tab

eg: <a href="link/path">click me</a>
<a href="path to file" download>click</a>

images: we can insert images in HTML using img tag. 
img tag uses attributes like
  src -- conains link/path of the images
  alt -- contains alternative title which works in the absence of src
we can even set height and width of the images using height and width properties
